# 📚 Amazon Book Analysis Project

## 📝 Overview
This project analyzes Amazon's book dataset to uncover insights into bestselling authors and their performance over the years. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we visualize the top authors based on book appearances, unique book counts, and total reviews. The analysis spans a decade (2009–2019), offering a comprehensive look at trends in the book industry.

## ✨ Features of the Analysis
- **👤 Top Authors by Appearances**  
  A horizontal line plot highlights the top 20 authors based on the number of times their books appear in the dataset.

- **📖 Unique Books Published**  
  A comparison of unique books published by each top author, identifying the most prolific authors.

- **⭐ Total Reviews**  
  A bar chart displays the cumulative number of reviews (in thousands) for each author's books, showcasing their popularity and reader engagement.

## 🛠️ Key Steps in the Code
1. **🔄 Data Preparation**:
   - Filtered the top 20 authors based on their number of appearances.
   - Removed duplicate book names to accurately analyze unique books.

2. **📊 Visualization**:
   - Created subplots to display appearances, unique book counts, and total reviews.
   - Used Seaborn color palettes and annotations for enhanced clarity.

## 📚 Libraries Used
- **📦 Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **🎨 Matplotlib**: For creating detailed subplots.
- **🌈 Seaborn**: For adding aesthetic elements to the visualizations.
- **🔢 NumPy**: For numerical operations.
